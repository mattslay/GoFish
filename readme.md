The main goal of this project is:

- Providing advanced replace 
- GoFish can search content on any other text file too, the difference is to deal with VFP table based sources

### Known issues
Due to the way GoFish stores the code around the hits, the search may fail with memo file to large. See issue #49.  
This may happen as well, if too many results are visible in the history (with memo loaded).   
The search brings one hit per line, even if there is more then one hit in this line.
The replace function just replaces all hits per line. There is not hint about multiple hits at all.
