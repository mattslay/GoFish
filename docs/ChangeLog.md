### Fixes
- Fixed: When the results are shown and the order of the results is changed by clicking the header of column "Proccode", "Statement" or "Code" then the error "SQL: ORDER BY clause in invalid" was thrown. This was fixed by also excluding these columns in the functions "SortColumn" and "SortColumSecondary".
- Fixed: When the search option "Whole word" was active then it could happen that too many higlightings where shown in the HTML preview. This affected only lines with an appropiate result (matching "Whole word") and having another inappropiate result (not matching "Whole word).

- Fixed: For results that are part of a class-container and used in a form with a formset GF showed a wrong "name" (or you may call it "path") in the results. 
### Changes
- Improved: Some changes were made to "gofishsearchengine.prg" so that GF can wrap up the results even faster.
- Improved: When clicking "Edit" to open a form or class of the selected result and this file could not be opened then nothing happened. From now on GF will tell you that the file canÂ´t be opened and why not.

## Previous releases
- Ver 5.0.163 - Released 2017-02-12
- Ver 5.0.162 - Released 2016-12-06

## What's new in version 5.0:
### Changes
- Saved Search History â You can now save the history of your searches, either automatically (for all searches) or selectively, and can restore the search parameters and results grid from these saved searches.  You can also selectively delete your saved searches or use the GF Janitor to automatically delete old ones.
- More powerful filter options â You can filter on secondary matches in the code "in the neighborhood" (that is, in the same statement or same procedure) of the original match; the filter form has been re-organized to provide clarity; and filters can be combined using logical operators AND or OR.
- Handling of PRG-based classes â Special attention has been paid to matches in PRG-based classes, which now are treated as much as possible like VCX-based classes. Their names appear in the "Class", "Base Class", and "Parent Class" columns in the grid and also in the new category "Classes" in the Treeview.
- Treeview changes â There are a few new categories: "Classes", "Menus", and "Projects". The "Classes" category, unlike all the other categories which have files as sub-nodes, has classes as sub-nodes. 
- Column Changes  â There are two new columns, "Parent Class VCX" and "Containing Class"; the column headings for some of the other columns have been reworded; and the contents of some of the class-related columns have been enhanced.
- Plug-In to control the grid display â You can set the use the plug-in to set the Dynamic* (or any other) properties of the grid. The sample provided changes the colors used for each row.
- Other UI changes â There are many, many other UI changes, including the ability to select the location of the Code View window relative to the grid.
