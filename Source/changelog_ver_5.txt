**Ver 5.0.208** Released 2022-10-16

**Ver 5.0.207** Released 2022-10-16
* Improved: Added option to allow code window to be opened at stored position. (Option: Open code windows at top left corner)

**Ver 5.0.205** Released 2022-08-16
* Fixed: When the results are shown and the order of the results is changed by clicking the header of column "Proccode", "Statement" or "Code" then the error "SQL: ORDER BY clause in invalid" was thrown. This was fixed by also excluding these columns in the functions "SortColumn" and "SortColumSecondary".
* Fixed: When the search option "Whole word" was active then it could happen that too many higlightings where shown in the HTML preview. This affected only lines with an appropiate result (matching "Whole word") and having another inappropiate result (not matching "Whole word).
* Improved: Some changes were made to "gofishsearchengine.prg" so that GF can wrap up the results even faster.
* Fixed: On clicking "Edit" to open the file of the selected result could lead to error "Variable 'CR' is not found.".
* Fixed: For results that are part of a class-container and used in a form with a formset GF showed a wrong "name" (or you may call it "path") in the results. 
* Improved: When clicking "Edit" to open a form or class of the selected result and this file could not be opened then nothing happened. From now on GF will tell you that the file can´t be opened and why not.

** Ver 5.0.169 ** Released 2021-03-24
1. Removed matches from a Project PJX on the "Key" field (i.e. Match Type = "<Key>" in the results grid.)

** Ver 5.0.168 ** Released 2021-03-23
1. In the search results grid, if **Match Type** is`<<<Filename>>` (i.e. matching a filename in a Project), then double-clicking on the row will now open the file with correct editor. (Contributed by Jim Nelson)
2. In the search results treeview, the results are now ordered by Class, Filename, FilePath. (Contributed by Jim Nelson)
3. GoFishSearchEngine.vcx has been converted to PRGs file. The 2 classes in the VCX are replaced by GoFishSearchEngine.prg and GoFishSearchOptions.prg. This was done to remove binaries (VCX) from the code base, in hopes of making it easier to maintain the source code in a more source control friendly style.
4. Converted GF_PEME_BaseTools.vcx to prg.

** Ver 5.0.164 ** - Released 2021-03-19
1. Fixed a bug in Delete feature of Search History form that could allow GF to delete (essentially) all files and folders starting at the root path of the disk. Error was reported in Issue #9 on the GitHub Issue Tracker. https://github.com/mattslay/GoFish/issues/9
2. Added text source code files for VCX and SCX files, as generated by FoxBin2Prg.
3. Thor maintainers will need to release a new `Thor_Update_GoFish5.prg` updater to distribute this update.
